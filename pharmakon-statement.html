Lineup Update for Pittsburgh Noise Fest</big></big><br>
<br>
It’s with real disappointment that we announce Pharmakon will no longer
be performing at this year’s fest.<br>
<br>
This was not an easy decision, and we want to acknowledge the
tremendous effort Pharmakon made to try and salvage a set for the
event. Unfortunately, a critical failure of the hardware that contains
years of her work has made it impossible to perform the planned set.
Despite our team doing everything possible to offer support, the
situation proved unworkable on such short notice.<br>
<br>
Pharmakon has expressed how deeply sorry she is to cancel and how
seriously she takes her commitments to live performance. We fully
support her decision to prioritize doing justice to her work and not
pushing through with a set that wouldn’t reflect the quality and
intensity she’s known for.<br>
<br>
We’re incredibly grateful for the time, communication, and honesty
she’s shown during a stressful and unfortunate situation.<br>
We know this is disappointing, trust us, we feel it too, but we’re
currently hard at work securing a new artist to bring something equally
powerful and fitting to the weekend. Stay tuned for the updated lineup
announcement.<br>
<br>
Thank you for understanding and for continuing to support the fest and
its artists with the same intensity we’ve felt building in this
community.<br>
