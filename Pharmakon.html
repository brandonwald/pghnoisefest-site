Pharmakon is the 18-year-old project of Margaret Chardiet, an artist
born and based in New York City. As one of the founding members of the
Red Light District collective in Far Rockaway, NY, Chardiet has been a
stalwart in the underground experimental scene since the age of
seventeen. She is known for her intense live performances and vocal
delivery. Her work as a whole is a celebration of the feral and the
visceral, a self-possession which seeks to purge the detritus of a
system that has never accepted anything it couldn&#8217;t also exploit.
Chardiet uses electronic synthesis as a tool to transfer this
viscerality physiologically and intra-spatially into the bodies of
their audience. Timbre becomes temper, a tameless social contagion or
biorhythm.</big><br>
