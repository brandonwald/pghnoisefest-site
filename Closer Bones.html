 artist Closer Bones has been creating genre-defying sound as therapy 
since 2012. Using assorted electronics &amp; contact microphones, Closer
 Bones weaves together harsh noise, power electronics, drone, glitch, 
&amp; more to create contemplative dynamic soundscapes. With 2019's &#8220;The
 Destroying Angel&#8221; on Black Ring Rituals Records they started the 
Apostate Electronics series, a sharp &amp; methodical auditory flaying 
&amp; exposition of the cult-like Jehovah's Witnesses. Other releases 
have focused on isolation, depression, anxiety, police brutality, 
oppression, &amp; more. Their work has been called &#8220;layered, 
complex&#8230;fresh &amp; inventive&#8221;. With appearances on radio stations in 
NYC, the UK, &amp; the midwest, along with live performances across the 
country, Closer Bones has continued to spread the word of personal 
salvation through noise &amp; community. They are also one of the 
primary driving forces behind the Manchester NH springtime heavy 
electronics festival Slabfest, which will have it&#8217;s 4th iteration on May
 17th &amp; 18th.</span></span></div>
