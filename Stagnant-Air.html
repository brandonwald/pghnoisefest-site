 you have little interest or pleasure in doing things? Have you been 
feeling down, depressed, or hopeless? Have you had trouble falling 
asleep, or have you been sleeping too much? Have you had a poor 
appetite, or have you been overeating? Have you been feeling bad about 
yourself - like you're a failure and you've let yourself or your family 
down? Trouble concentrating on things like watching television? Have you
 been moving so slowly that people have begun to notice, or have you 
been being so fidgety and restless that you've been moving around more 
than usual? Have you thought recently that you'd be better off dead or 
hurting yourself in some way? 
How difficult have these problems made it for you to do your work, take 
care of yourself, or get along with others?

Stagnant air is common foreshadowing that something bad is about to 
happen.</span></span></div>
